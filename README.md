# Intelligent Vehicle course project
The project contains two contests:
* A speed car racing contest: all we need is to be the winner in racing
* A car cruise contest: we need to be as fast as possible but minimizing the cruise error w.r.t the mid line.
The contests are based on the CyberTORCS platform for intelligent vehicle control simulation experiment.

We are proudly to be winner and create new best records since 2006(when the course was open) in both two contests.
